But after that first step of gradient descent, there is no more connection to performance. This means that minimizing this “loss” function, for a given batch of data, has no guarantee whatsoever of improving expected return. You can send this loss to -\infty and policy performance could crater; in fact, it usually will. Sometimes a deep RL researcher might describe this outcome as the policy “overfitting” to a batch of data. This is descriptive, but should not be taken literally because it does not refer to generalization error.

We raise this point because it is common for ML practitioners to interpret a loss function as a useful signal during training—”if the loss goes down, all is well.” In policy gradients, this intuition is wrong, and you should only care about average return. The loss function means nothing.
